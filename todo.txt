    in search_tv_series_names if using tvrage the comparison should be no_accents.
     but this will only affect a minority of programs. So I wont code this.

BUG: parsing VIDEO_TS eg /share/Complete/hulk wolverine

Verify no more /./ scan paths.

BUG: The picture may be downloaded twice if the second scan occurs before the picture is downloaded.
but also have to be mindful of UPDATE_POSTERS option. We only want one picture per scan process.
SOLUTION: jpeg_fetch should check if the picture is  newer than the catalog process...
catalog can pass PID. jpeg fetch will only download picure if it is older than /proc/PID


BUG:oversight.sh: When deleting a film - delete the nfo file
FEATURE:catalog: If not category found by title - look at text of search results.

Check logic when .nfo file is called .NFO. It appears to be 
    1. ignored when looking for imdb url.
    2. ignored during relocate/rename

BUG When adding share cancel button says 'ask'
BUG!! Rename of DVD folder incorrect. 
given /path/to/dvd/VIDEO_TS
