As things are currently in beta - if something doesnt work as expected its quite possible its is a bug. Rather than spending hours tearing your hair out, send the log files to me :)

As the software matures hopefully this will happen less often.

=Scan Logs - send these you have problems with adding or updating content=


To send scan logs:

  # (on the TV/NMT go to Setup/NMT Applications) and make sure SMB/Samba service is started.
  # On your PC, open windows explorer and in the address bar type \\192.168.x.y where 192.168.x.y is the IP address of your NMT.
  # Browse to Apps\oversight\
  # Right click on the logs folder and zip it (send to Compressed Folder/Winzip/7zip/Winrar etc)
  # Email the new compressed file to me. nmt at lordy dot org period uk.
  # In the email mention one or two specific examples of the problem. Eg. The file "star trek 2009.avi" is indexed as "Star Trek Series 20 episode 9" (just an example - that shouldn't really happen ;) )
  # If you have reported the problem in the Oversight Threads on NMT forums mention your forum name/handle and the post number in the email.

If you are a super-smarty pants, you have look in the logs and have a good idea *what* is causing oversight to trip up you could even raise  [http://code.google.com/p/oversight/issues/list a new defect] and attach the logs directly. To do this, You only need to work out 'what' is causing the trouble not 'why' :) 
Eg if scanning always fails on a particular file name, then that information along with the filename and the logs is enough.

= GUI Logs - send these if odd things happen in the user interface=

Send 'gui' logs if you think files have scanned OK but you are getting odd things happen in the user interface.

To send GUI logs:

  # Open Oversight in the PC. Go to OVersight->Setup->Oversight Jukebox Settings General and set log level to '1' (NO MORE!), and save , 
  # now go back to the page that is causing problems. 
  # if using Internet Explorer or Firefox, In the browser menu,  select File->Save As-> Type: Web Page HTML Only
  # email the page to me as an attachment  nmt AT lordy dot org Dot uk.
  # If you have reported the problem in the Oversight Threads on NMT forums mention your forum name/handle and the post number in the email.
