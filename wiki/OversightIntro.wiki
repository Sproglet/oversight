Oversight is a minimalistic Jukebox that runs on the NMT platform, with unique features such as Usenet downloader post processing. 

It is aimed at users that regularly download content to their internal hard drive, and who want to quickly identify and access the most recently downloaded material.

There are quite a few [http://www.networkedmediatank.com/wiki/index.php/Jukebox_Comparison jukeboxes] for the NMT platform now. Selecting the right one can be challenging. Especially if you start with ones that are not suitable for your own usage patterns.

Here I have listed the main strengths and weaknesses of Oversight.

=Advantages of Oversight==

  * No PC needed to scan and update media.
  * Easy to install and use - as no PC is required this makes installation very clean.
  * Automatic addition of new media without any extra work.
  * Auto mount and playback from multiple NAS( including ISOs)
  * All content from different sources displayed in a single view. (Some might consider this a weakness if they really want separate jukeboxes) 
  * Wide variety of file naming formats detected. 
  * Scene names detected. No need to rename those downloads.
  * Mark shows as watched.
  * Delete files using gui.
  * Sort and filter views dynamically. Filters can be combined.. eg Unwatched Movies beginning with 'T', or Watched Tv Shows beginning with 'M'.
  * Read-Only - Does not write to media folders so can run along side other Jukeboxes.
  * Does not depend on MyIHome service.
  * Interface works both on TV and browser.
  * Remote play - Click on browser - starts playing on TV.
  * Proper SD support. I have an SD tv! So it's not just an after thought that requires extra setting up. Downside is that HD may not look great. I try to test HD modes on PC Browser but need feedback from others until I buy a TV.
  * Dynamic hiding/removal of deleted files.
  * Avoids timeout issues with disconnected media archives.
  * NZBGet post-processing scripts. - Oversight installs a script that automatically adds new media to the Oversight Catalog. This script also has many features.
  * Crossview: If you have two NMT, and install Oversight on each, then you can see all media in a single Oversight session. No need to switch sources or jukeboxes.
 
=Disadvantages of Oversight=
  * Multi-lingual support (I plan to address this in later releases)
  * Detailed Scraping. Actor Bios, Names of Producers, Cleaners and all that kind of stuff is not supported. Via the PC, Oversight provides a link to IMDB.
  * Looks. Oversight has a basic skin which I will improve over time however features like reflection and 'dvd boxing' etc are unlikely to appear.
  * Skins. Oversight has a skin capability but this is relatively new and non-standard. There are not many skins.
  * Media attribute detection. Currently display of framerates etc is not supported.
  * TV Series in ISO Images not supported. (This is on the roadmap)


By default it shows the most recently downloaded content first. When combined with automated nzb downloading this provides an environment that can automatically record series and announce when new content is ready for viewing, much like a PVR. 


*Oversight is currently in beta. This means that there is a new version every couple of weeks. I make a best effort at testing but it has a lot of major feature sets (unpacking, deep web search/scrapes , dynamic gui, skins, auto-mounting, NMT sharing etc) and to run a comprehensive test suite would literally take hours. So my current practice is to sanity test, release the changes into the community rapidly, and they can feed back any issues. 
At present this seems to be working ok, and allows me to spend more time coding than testing.*
