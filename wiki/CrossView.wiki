CrossView allows you to install Oversight on two NMTs and they can both share media in a single view.

It is slightly different to using a NAS.

For NAS, your NMT must scan the NAS and add the media into the main oversight index.

For Crossview, your NMT displays a combination of its own Oversight Index and a remote Oversight index at the same time.

Note for Cross View to work :

0. Make sure OVersight is installed on both NMTs, and make sure they each have a network source that points to the other.

1. the Remote NMT mount must be active. The easiest way to do this is to select the Remote NMT in the standard NMT Sources screen.(I will make this nicer at some point). 

2. Enable the crossview option in oversight..

3. That's it. Now Both Oversight menus are visible in a single view. Here is an example where there menu is filtered for Horrors beginning with 'E'. In this case each NMT had its own copy of 'Eden Park' on their internal disk, and now both are showing:

The Title bar shows the source if it is not on the internal HD.

The details page shows the source also.
