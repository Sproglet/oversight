= Introduction =

[http://www.dentedboxes.com/doku.php/Eversionb2 Eversion] is a flash based front end developed by user Accident. This is used as a front end to XML data generated by YAMJ.

After installing Oversight,
Install Eversion using the CSI package from the DentedBoxes website.

Then in Eversion edit the settings file (/share/Apps/eversion/eversion/settings/esettings-default.xml ) and set the yamjdatapath to one of the following on order of preference:

For r2312+ use this URL for faster image loading (more info here )
{{{
Fast option. Uses Apache configuration to serve static images to Eversion, bypassing Oversight

<yamjdatapath>http://nmt.ip.address:9999/oversight/yamj/</yamjdatapath> 

Slow option but running under Apache is more stable.

<yamjdatapath>http://nmt.ip.address:9999/oversight/oversight.cgi?yamj/</yamjdatapath> 

Slow option. Uses NMT built in web server that leaves dead processes around.

<yamjdatapath>http://nmt.ip.address:8883/oversight/oversight.cgi?yamj/</yamjdatapath> 
}}}

You can then launch Eversion from /share/Apps/eversion/eversion.pcf 
Or install the YAMJ app from the market, to launch from Web Services.

For additional eSkins see [http://www.networkedmediatank.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=112 YAMJ Skin Forum] and search for eSkin and/or Eversion.
There are some differences in the way YAMJ and Oversight work to be aware of:
  # YAMJ gathers full media meta-data using MediaInfo - Oversight does not do this yet - for performance reasons mainly.
  # Oversight is dynamic and has Delete/Delist features that are not supported in YAMJ skins.
  # Oversight treats episodes as distinct media, whereas at present, YAMJ treats episodes as part of the same media. The VIDEOSOURCE information in YAMJ is currently stored at the media level and not the episode level. If you have duplicate episodes in a TV Detail page , Oversight will append the VIDEOSURCE to the title, so you can differentiate between HDTV and WEB, PROPER, REPACK. etc.
