Oversight launches incremental scans in three instances:

1. On completion of a usenet download.
2. When new content is added to 'watch folder'
3. When a NMT Transmission Torrent is completed (this needs more testing)

I plan I have a rescan button against a particular item. 
First we need an edit option to change IMDB Id., fanart & poster links.
Then "save" or "save and rescan"

In the mean time yo can manually rescan if you have telnet installed.

  #log in
  #type 'cd /share/Apps/oversight'
  #type './catalog.sh /path/to/new/media/folder'
  #Or to get new posters type './catalog.sh UPDATE_POSTERS /path/to/new/media/folder'
