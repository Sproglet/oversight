Once in a while, a beta may be a bit - well - beta, and you may prefer to roll back to an earlier version whilst awaiting some much needed fixes. 

The easier way to do this is using CSI.
first download the earlier version  directly from

http://code.google.com/p/nmt-mini-installer/source/browse/#svn/downloads/oversight

(select the version you want and then 'view raw file' and save)

Then using the CSI installer (http://www.nmtinstaller.com) - select 'File->Install From File' and browse to your previously saved zip file.
