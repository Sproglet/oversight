The oversight.cgi script was ported to C.
This makes it more responsive and allows addition of more features without affecting performance.
The main difference between the previous version of oversight is the addition of 
html templates and support for fanart.
These are both in their infancy.

To get fanart for existing movies you have to rescan them.
Th get fanart for existing tv shows either rescan or wait until another episode is added.
