#How to build oversight.

At present oversight is built using bash/make etc. I may port this to ant if this gives more flexibility.

To Build an environment:

  # Windows only: Install cygwin
  # Install gcc+make
  # Install mips gcc toolchain
  # build


== Cygwin ==

If using windows install [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin]. Most of my development is on cygwin. And some of the quick update scripts assume you are using cygwin drive mappings.
(Select the gcc and make packages in the installer)

== GCC + Make == 
Install Gcc + make if you haven't already.

== Mips Toolchain ==

Download the mips toolchains from the following locations:
  * Windows
    * 
    *
  * Linux
    * 
    *
  * Mac
