==Skin Macros==

Go to [SkinMacros] for more information on Skin Macros. If the documentation is lacking see section "Examining the source code"

==Variables==

Variables can be used to hold text to oputput directly to the HTML page, or they can simple numeric expressions, used in IF/THEN/ELSE tests.

Macros are similar to functions. They can take arguments and produce different output depending on the arguments. Variables are just little bits of text.

===Direct output===
The syntax for outputting a variable is 

{{{
[:$variable_name:]
}}}

eg 

{{{
width=[:$ovs_image_width:]
}}}

===Passing Variables to macros===

Variables can be passed as arguments to macros eg.

{{{
[:SOME_MACRO($some_variable):]
}}}

===Types of Variables===

All of the config files in /share/Apps/oversight/conf are loaded as predefined variables. (constants really)

oversight.cfg settings become $ovs_* variables. eg $ovs_version
catalog.cfg settings become $catalog_* variables
unpak.cfg settings become $unpak_* variables.

The default settings are store in the corresponding defaults file. Eg .oversight.cfg.defaults. 
As the user changes settings they are stored in the main file.


====User configurable skin variables and skin.cfg====

Also the skin.cfg for the current skin

{{{
/share/Apps/oversight/templates/<skin_name>/conf
}}}

is loaded as $skin_* variables.

If developing skins you should only put things you WANT the user to change in the 

{{{
/share/Apps/oversight/templates/<skin_name>/conf/.skin.cfg.defaults
}}}

As the user changes settings they are stored in skin.cfg.
The name must start with "skin_"

To allow the user to edit the settings add a corresponding entry to
{{{
/share/Apps/oversight/templates/<skin_name>/help/skin.cfg.help
}}}

eg
{{{
skin_height:The height of the blah - free text
skin_width:The width from 110 to 140 - drop down list|110|120|130|140
}}}

===Private skin variables===

If you want variables that you DO NOT want the user to change, then user the SET macro,
and the variable names begin with underscore

eg.

{{{
[:SET(_height,440):]
}}}

and reference it in the usual way:

{{{ 
<img src=... height=[:$_height:] >
}}}

If you want to set these variables for your entire skin then put the SET macros in a template (e.g. vars.template ) , and include that template in your other templates.

==Examining the source code==

Until the documentation is completed the best place for information are the existing templates and the source code.

===Macros===

For macros eg [:XXX:] look in http://code.google.com/p/oversight/source/browse/trunk/src/macro.c

Eg for information on the "POSTER" macro, search the file for "POSTER" you will find a line like
{{{
hashtable_insert(macros,"POSTER",macro_fn_poster);
}}}

Then search for the corresponding function (in this case function macro_fn_poster ) and review the function. Especially call_info->args
{{{
/**
* =begin wiki
* ==POSTER==
*
* Display poster for current item.
*
* [:POSTER:]
* [:POSTER(attributes):]
*
* =end wiki
*/
char *macro_fn_poster(MacroCallInfo *call_info)
{
}}}

===Variables===

For predefined variables eg @sd of [:IF($@sd):] look in http://code.google.com/p/oversight/source/browse/trunk/src/variables.c
