Use gawk specific match array extensions instead of chop function

use gensub instead of chop - eg in tv pattern recognition

Add reverse db -> Actort Name to ovsid for the sites that do not have Actor Ids (including tvdb)


When searching a Movie by filename, a Title/Year scrape can be more accurate than an IMDB scrape especially if either:

1. The web engine summary of the Torrent sites list ids of other movies next to the files OR

2. The movie wad originally posted with the wrong IMDB id, but this wrong ID has propogated to the web,
   in this case deleting the nfo and rescanning does not fix (unless we scan for title and not imdb id)
    Example http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8;eo=UTF-8;p=%22haideaf-cracks%22+imdb
     detected as Fish Tank due to original bad nfo.

Also prioritising Title/Year search will help with moving away from IMDB over dependance
