*Q1. How can I get oversight to rename and move Films that were already on the PCH _before_ I installed oversight?*

A with telnet you can do

{{{/share/Apps/oversight/catalog.sh RENAME /share/Completed}}}

I would only do this if Oversight is getting all of the film names correct, otherwise they will end up in a wrongly named folder.
(This is one reason Oversight doesnt change the name of the actual movie avi file yet, I will only add that once Oversight becomes more accurate)



*Q2. How do I download to an external hard drive?*

A. To download content to an external HDD you must change the film_folder_fmt and tv_file_fmt settings in oversight->admin->renaming.

For content other than movies or tv shows, also change the oversight->admin->Nzbget unpacking->completed_dir to be the full path to a folder on the external HDD. 

*Q3. how to default to sort by name instead of age?*

A. This will become an configurable option soon. In the mean time, You can change the initial default by editing the web service in the main NTM setup screen to be.
