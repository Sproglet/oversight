# Full Scans #

With Version 20091123-3beta upwards, Full Scans should now only be done when:

  * Oversight is installed for the first time. (in which case 'new' scan does the same thing
  * Oversight has been removed and re-installed. (ditto)
  * Oversight upgrade instructions suggest a full rescan - this is often to change some internal data.
  * You have quite a few false matches and have just upgraded Oversight, and want to see if it fixes them.
  * The previous full scan was affected by lost internet connectivity or site unavailability.

Before doing a rescan use the site checker link "{check internet databases}".
(See the FAQ for why 3 search engines are used)
