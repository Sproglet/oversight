catalogh.sh.full:3697 - replace wget with a script that will get a poster and create sd and hd versions.
Allow optional imdb rating.

if abbreviation match then assume all other similar abbreviations IN THE SAME FOLDER are the same.

check torrent watch

BUG: parsing VIDEO_TS eg /share/Complete/hulk wolverine

Verify no more /./ scan paths.

Q. Why are we scraping IMDB for TV shows?

Have seperate rescan and watch folders. /share/Tv and /sahre/Movies do not need to be watched.

DONE: Add TV_MODE=0 warning!

After selecting/deleting return to the same view.

FEATURE: amazon scrape - Some crazy people put Amazon links in nfo eg.
http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006HAWP In this case scrape the URL for ttnnnnnnn

Play from menu

BUG: The picture may be downloaded twice if the second scan occurs before the picture is downloaded.
but also have to be mindful of UPDATE_POSTERS option. We only want one picture per scan process.
SOLUTION: jpeg_fetch should check if the picture is  newer than the catalog process...
catalog can pass PID. jpeg fetch will only download picure if it is older than /proc/PID

Option to check IMDB or Amazon for tv series posters? Test with Grand Designs

Rescan: Add a Rescan link/option

Samples: still not getting deleted!

1080p mode when tv on 720 /etc/tvmode=16
http://www.networkedmediatank.com/showthread.php?tid=14410&pid=202554#pid202554


tvdb use url http://thetvdb.com//api/GetSeries.php?seriesname=the%20unusuals
then search for imdb id xml tab, then ise series id tag, poster is
http://images.thetvdb.com/banners/_cache/posters/73739-7.jpg
Posters can be picked by reverse -5,-4,-3,-2,-1.jpg etc.

movie db - search direct for imdbid
http://www.themoviedb.org/search?search[text]=tt1013752


single result will have movie url on page as
http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/13804
then that page will have
http://images.themoviedb.org/posters/12457/Fast_and_Furious_cover.jpg (small)
link to http://images.themoviedb.org/posters/12457/Fast_and_Furious.jpg

BUG:oversight.sh: When deleting a film - delete the nfo file
FEATURE:catalog: If not category found by title - look at text of search results.

BUG:oversight: removing donate logo causes:

"ERROR awk: cmd. line:2048: Unexpected token".

==============================================================
FEATURE: Scene keywords. Some can be partial words 720P*
==============================================================
BUG: ovs: Deleting last item in drilldown gives blank screen
==============================================================
BUG: ovs: Deleting VIDEO_TS doesnt work?
==============================================================
BUG: ovs: episode text stays small
==============================================================


Check logic when .nfo file is called .NFO. It appears to be 
    1. ignored when looking for imdb url.
    2. ignored during relocate/rename


BUG: make lock file only active during update to db (not during scraping)

DVD icon on tv overview
Make 'delete' and 'mark' work with cross view
tvid search broken
BUG When adding share cancel button says 'ask'
BUG!! Rename of DVD folder incorrect. 
given /path/to/dvd/VIDEO_TS
it will move all contents of /path/to. This should be prevented by a Media/Folder count. Review.

BUG!! unpak still does a par repair after sanilty check fail (test using nzb with 1st segment of a file/rar headr removed)
BUG!! VIDEO_TS are removed on re-scan?
BUG!! Renamed Complete
BUG!! When renaming Video/Ts we should introduce a new subdir to avoid renaming the parent folder. or need special rules for VTS
BUG: To differentiate betwen game iso and video iso, mount and check VIDEO_TS etc.

TODO Undo rename feature - how
FEATURE 1: Film file renaming.
FEATURE: Add more search heuristics:

BUG 1 catalog.sh: if oversight not present - set poster location to with_video
BUG 1 Add onkeyup on lower menu bar to go to table. Similarly for top menu (onkeydown)
BUG 2 Cope with Unicode - either store and pass through OR replace with latin equivs.
BUG 2 TODO Fix installer for linux/mac
BUG 3 If tvnzb pauses nzbget and an unpak is running it will resume it if using the pause option.
BUG 4 When a script errors and nzbget pause is being used - it doesnt resume
BUG 5 - AKA needs to check country/language of main title first.

FEATURE 1 torrent version needs to deal with files going straight to Downloads. Waiit for new commands in 1.60
FEATURE 1 Parental access : with auto certificate based defaults
FEATURE 1 Cross Play extreme :) Allow one oversight session to see all media.
FEATURE 2 Play back from browser links.
FEATURE 2 Grab Plot Summary
BUG 2 oversight: Sort playlist for TV programs.
FEATURE 2 oversight: Add left-right navigation on level 2
FEATURE 2 oversight: Add Category change TV<->Film Unknown->TV|Film
FEATURE 2 oversight: removable media - dont remove stuff if the share has gone away. Need to use df command on folder to determine share. (symlinks?) What to do? This ties in with remote viewing also.
FEATURE 3: Amazon search if not found on IMDB/epguides?
FEATURE 3 Add option to catalog.sh to add files without flagging as new. This is for torrents that have just moved location. (wait for Transmission 1.60)
FEATURE 3 oversight: hot key file back to gaya browser. using /?filter=0 + index.html
FEATURE 3 tvnzb, torrent links.
FEATURE 3 unpak : grab subtitles.
FEATURE 4 NTSC vs PAL scaling.
FEATURE 4 Cope with Program files not present in tvnfo. (eg foreign)
FEATURE 5 BINTUBE Search - may not work. Dont want to rely on odd sites.
FEATURE 5 add streaming when files are clicked on PC web browser

TEST oversight: post-update script
TEST catalog: Big Brother format.
TEST catalog: avi prefix.

TEST 1 MAKE SURE unpak_movie_folder_format and unpak_tv_file_format are moved to catalog.sh FILM_FOLDER_FMT and TV_FILE_FMT
TEST 1 oversight: Allow view of remote INDEX.DB, remap path for file references.  make sure operations are sent to correct oversight.sh LISTENER (no security!)

DONE: Scanning quote file fix
DONE: Fix when epguide links to Pilot Episode and not series.
DONE installer changes AllowReprocess and ParCheck
DONE Use parent folder for search if it contains only one folder AND is registered in gFolderCount ie it was inside our original search list.
DONE Do a search with all optional, then extract most frequnet emphasized text. or which has most imdb links
DONE If title contains year , then do a search and extract from year backwards, - added weighting for year.
DONE Google search filename - get longest substring. then google substring+imdb. Justify.
DONE DRYRUN feature
DONE: Check new content highlighting
DONE Complete generate_nfo_files with xmbc format.
DONE unpak not invoking catalog with RENAME
DONE unpak: fixed bug getting pars with new versions of nzbget
DONE IMDB link ok but epguides is broken Try to identify what is happening when 34 xx 34 appears.
DONE Presence of nfo throws off logic. 
DONE Supress jpg downloads
DONE Centralise poster downloads. (good for Read-Only partitions)
DONE The Tudors not logged.
DONE Address House to House MD mapping.
DONE 2 config.cgi (General configuration editor - use tvnzb code)
DONE 1 Address search issue raised in email a while back
DONE Web service urls only allow single parameter & get url encoded. - fix
    have single arg which is url decoded and passed back to query string
   OR just have a new index page off the web service page listing oversight, tvnzb and zebedee.
DONE Exclude Paths. / Exclude Names

DONE oversight: Default button on drilldown set to first media file
DONE catalog: Only pages if cache if it looks like a TV show
DONE oversight: Multi number search - Find '*DO*ctor' by going direct to channel '36' TVIDS
DONE oversight: Add Upgrade direct from website

DONE Deleted one episode but entire series disappeared then came back after rescan - however jpg deleted and should have been flagged as in use. review.
DONE Change mark/unmark logic, so marked items are already checked.
DONE VIDEO_TS
DONE A keyword search heuristic should look for a year then only include prior words before punctuation.  eg "blah blah : Title 2004 blah"
DONE When doing a deep search , if it already has tv format the 2nd search should be on epguides not on the web.
FIXED: unpack: sample delete.
FIXED: ctg: 2 part movies CD01/CD02
FIXED: unpak: sanity_check error http://www.networkedmediatank.com/showthread.php?tid=21592&pid=192791#pid192791
DONE: More robust nfo name creation
DONE Feature - use the Movie Db.org
