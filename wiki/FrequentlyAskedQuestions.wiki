===How can I get oversight to rename and move Films that were already on the PCH _before_ I installed oversight?*===

A with telnet you can do

{{{/share/Apps/oversight/catalog.sh RENAME /share/Completed}}}

I would only do this if Oversight is getting all of the film names correct, otherwise they will end up in a wrongly named folder.
(This is one reason Oversight doesnt change the name of the actual movie avi file yet, I will only add that once Oversight becomes more accurate)

===How do I clear the database?===

Delete the file /share/Apps/oversight/index.db. You can do this via the TV file browser or via Windows share etc.

=== Why two types of delete? ===

You can ether :
1. Completely delete a movie from Oversight and from your Hard Drive/Storage. OR
2. Just remove a file from the Oversight database, but keep it on your hard drive. (eg Home Video or Adult Content etc). In Oversight, this is called 'delisting'.

Some people prefer the *DELETE* button on the remote, to just Delist or hide items , others want it to really Delete  the item.

By default *DELETE* button on the remote will delist, but you can change it to a real file deletion, in the OVersight->Setup->Keys menu.

On the left is the Oversight action , on the right is the sequence of keys on the Remote to perform that action. These are also known as [http://www.networkedmediatank.com/wiki/index.php/Technical_Documentation#TVID_codes Tvid codes]

===How do I download to an external hard drive?===

A. To download content to an external HDD you must change the film_folder_fmt and tv_file_fmt settings in oversight->admin->renaming.

For content other than movies or tv shows, also change the oversight->admin->Nzbget unpacking->completed_dir to be the full path to a folder on the external HDD.

===When displaying by Age, how is 'Age' calculated?===

One of Oversight's goals is to act like a PVR, so the 'age' is generally the time the item was added to Oversight. This works well for incremental scans. However when doing a full scan, age is taken from the age of the file itself. Broadcast or Release age is not used at present.

===Why does Oversight use 3 different search engines?===

A. No one really ask this much, but it might cross their mind when using the site checker. To reduce false positives, some queries are performed against two different search engines. If they disagree, then a third engine is used for the casting vote. This has made searches much more accurate and reduced false positives. It is important that the search engines are not re-badged versions of one another or we'd get the same results.
(eg Ask = Google)

===Can I use Oversight to manage my home movies or Movies not in IMDB==

At present, Oversight is not really ready to manage movies that do not have IMDB ids. Oversight needs the ability to edit the database, and read XMBC nfo informantion. Both of which are on the todo list.

In the mean time, If you have a 200 series NMT a new firmware will be out soon that has some jukebox function that may suit your needs.

===Can I improve the fanart quality===

All html pages are 720 on NMT then upscaled as necessary , but you can improve the quality by editing  (with a Unix friendly editor)
/share/Apps/oversight/bin/jpg_fetch_and_scale line 54
[code]
      */_fa/*.hd.jpg) o="-width=1280 -height=720" ; q=85 ;;
[/code]

change q=85 to q=90 or q=95 to see if that's better.
