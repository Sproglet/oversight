= Your First Scan =

Before you run your first scan you must add your media sources to *either* the scan paths *or* the watch paths.

The scan_paths and the watch_paths are comma separated lists of media sources..

eg /share/Video,/USB_DRIVE_A-1,MYNAS

The NMT runs Linux which (unlike Windows) has case sensitive filenames. This means that /share/Video and /share/video are not the same.

For a single 'one-off' scan, you should add the source to the 'scan_paths'
If you want Oversight to regularly check the source for new content, add the source to the 'watch_paths'.

*Do not add the source to both.* - I'll check for this soon.

By default Oversight is initially configured to scan the following folders (used by the 'nzbget' post-processing script)

  * /share/Complete
  * /share/Tv
  * /share/Movies

==Source on Internal HDD ==
To add a folder on the Internal HDD just enter the path to the folder. E.g. 
{{{
/share/Video
}}}

All paths on the internal HDD must start with '/share/'

==Source on USB ==

To add a folder on USB enter the path to the folder. This can be just the USB device name with a leading '/'. E.g.
{{{
/USB_DRIVE_A-1
}}}

== Source on a NAS ==

To add a folder on a network drive, you must first define the source in the standard NMT Network Sources setup window, and make sure you can browse to it OK. 
For example the following link shows a network source called 'test' pointing to a server called TRACY-SNG and the folder on the share is called Videos.

Once the share has been set up, Then add the source name (in this case 'test' ) to Oversight's scan_paths _or_ watch_paths, _without any leading slash._ . 
{{{
scan_paths=test
}}}
OR if you want Oversight to keep watching for new videos:
{{{
watch_paths=test
}}}



This will scan the folder 'Videos'. If a specific folder on the shared drive is required then also add '/' followed by the folder name. E.g.
{{{
scan_paths=test/Movies
}}}
OR
{{{
watch_paths=test/Movies
}}}

will now scan smb://TRACY-SNG/Videos/Movies


After you have set up the folders click the 'Rescan All Media' option http://oversight.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/nav/set1/rescan.png to start a background scan.
