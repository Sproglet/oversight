Here is a summry of the most user-facing known issues with the latest beta:

  # Automatic scanning may not be working - for a workaround see http://www.networkedmediatank.com/showthread.php?tid=17637&pid=249190#pid249190
  # Re-installing nzbget will stop Oversight unpacking - to fix you must re-install Oversight (either via CSI , or simply go to the Oversight folder using the TV browser, then select file mode, and click oversight-installer.html)
  # Certain film titles are interpreted as TV shows. eg 1408. Oversight starts looking at the folder name for more tv information instead of searching for movie information eg. /share/Movies/102.minutes.that.changed.america.avi vs /share/Tv/Lost/102.pilot.avi. For now an nfo with imdb id should help.
