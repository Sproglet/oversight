Here are some skins for Oversight. 
  
==Dedicated HTML Skins using Oversight Templates==

Oversight comes bundled with a number of HTML based skins that support all Oversight dynamic functions (eg Delete file / PC View)
See Settings->Appearance->Skins 
New HTML skins are being developed which is good for 100 series NMT that will not be migrating to the newer flash interface.

For latest skins see [http://www.networkedmediatank.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=107 Oversight Forum]
Some of these skins are at various stages of development.

==Flash Skins (aka eSkins) via Eversion==

Eversion/YAMJ skins can be loaded directly. However they will not support Oversight dynamic changes.
For more on Eversion skins see OversightAndEversion

==Dedicated Oversight Flash Skins (aka eSkins) via Eversion==

Eventually a goal is to have flash skins that support Oversight dynamic features, for the 200/300 series NMTs. None are available at present.  These might be mods of existing YAMJ skins with extra button support.
