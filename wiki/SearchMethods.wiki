 Searches nfo files at bintube and binsearch websites.
  * Excellent for scene release filenames.
  * OK for movies with distinctive titles in the filename.
  * Bad for movies with filenames consisting of a few common English words. eg Wanted.avi

==IMDBTITLE==
  Extracts the main keywords from the title , removes any format info (eg DVDRip),
and then searches the web for those words and "imdb" and picks the first one.
  * Good for movies with distinctive titles in the filename.
  * Hit an Miss for Remakes unless the year is specified in the filename.
  * Poor for Scene release filenames.

==IMDBLINK== 
  Extracts the main keywords from the title , removes any format info (eg DVDRip),
and then searches the web for those words and "imdb" , but excludes the IMDB wesite itself and also olny selects a link which occurs significantly more often than other links.
  * OK for scene releases.
  * Good for movies with distinctive titles in the filename.
  * Good at not picking anything if it can be confused with a remake. (Low false positives but then needs another search method to finish the job)
