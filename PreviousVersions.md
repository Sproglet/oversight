Once in a while, a beta may be a bit - well - beta, and you may prefer to roll back to an earlier version whilst awaiting some much needed fixes.

The easier way to do this is using CSI.
first download the earlier version  directly from

http://code.google.com/p/oversight/downloads/list?can=1&q=csi_oversight


Then using the CSI installer (http://www.nmtinstaller.com) - select 'File->Install From File' and browse to your previously saved zip file.


For even earlier versions go to  http://code.google.com/p/nmt-mini-installer/source/browse/#svn/downloads/oversight select the version you want and then 'view raw file' and save.

Note the last stable version [r571](https://code.google.com/p/oversight/source/detail?r=571) does not work with IMDB. To re-install this so that it works correctly follow the steps [here](http://www.networkedmediatank.com/showthread.php?tid=17637&pid=347577#pid347577)
