Oversight launches incremental scans in three instances:

  # On completion of a usenet download.
  # When new content is added to 'watch folder'
  # When a NMT Transmission Torrent is completed (this needs more testing)

I plan I have a rescan button against a particular item. 
First we need an edit option to change IMDB Id., fanart & poster links.
Then "save" or "save and rescan"

In the mean time yo can manually rescan if you have telnet installed.

  # log in
  # type 'cd /share/Apps/oversight'
  # type './catalog.sh /path/to/new/media/folder'
  # Or to get new posters type './catalog.sh UPDATE_POSTERS /path/to/new/media/folder'
