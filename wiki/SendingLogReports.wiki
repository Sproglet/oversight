As things are currently in beta - if something doesnt work as expected its quite possible its is a bug. Rather than spending hours tearing your hair out, send the log files to me :)

As the software matures hopefully this will happen less often.

To send me logs:

1. (on the TV/NMT go to Setup/NMT Applications) and make sure SMB/Samba service is started.

2. On your PC, open windows explorer and in the address bar type \\192.128.x.y where 192.168.x.y is the IP address of your NMT.

3. Browse to Apps\oversight\

4. Right click on the logs folder and zip it (send to Compressed Folder/Winzip/7zip/Winrar etc)

5. Email the new compressed file to me. nmt at lordy dot org period uk.

If you are a super-smarty pants, you have look in the logs and have a good idea *what* is causing oversight to trip up you could even raise a new defect and attach the logs directly. To do this, You only need to work out 'what' is causing the trouble not 'why' :) 
Eg if scanning always fails on a particular file name, then that information along with the filename and the logs is enough.
