    <h1>Oversight (nmt jukebox) &amp; unpak.sh post processor for nzbget</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;
</div>

<h2>1 May 2009: Note the current <a href="#fixes">beta</a> has some fixes </h2>
( Get the cross platform nzbget  <a href="#unpak">post processing scripts only</a> )

    <p>This is another jukebox but I think it is significantly different from other current offerings and it was born out of necessity for me.
    <p>Main Goals and features:
    <ul>
       <li>quicky find whatever has recently downloaded with <b>no searching or browsing at all</b>.</li>
       <li>Give me a an overview of what content I have <b>without too many page draws</b> (NMT is slow for non-video processing)</li>
       <li><b>Hands free, zero-touch indexing</b>, - no manual renaming of files to help the application do its work</li>
       <li>No dependency on a PC for indexing or generation of html etc.</li>
       <li>Load and go. Default configuration will index internal HD</li>
       <li>Looks good on SD. I have a 36 CRT, so the main overview is mostly text to save space. Some basic artwork is displayed on drill down. This is unlikely to change. Other video juke boxes are pretty, but not on SD. The NMT is not a fast platform for scrolling many pages of large DVD artwork on an SD screen.
       I have added some HighDef detection for a better layout in Flat Panel tvs. </li>
        <li>make as few assumptions as possible about the physical layout of folders, no moving files around to help the application work.</li>
        <li>Although there is now a full file renaming capability in unpak.sh/catalog.sh, it is not really needed anymore if using OverSight,
          I would only use it to change folder names. File names provide useful information if you have to ever rebuild from scratch.</li>
       </ul>
         <br><img src=os-tv1.png>
    <p><a href="#screenshots">More Screenshots</a>
    <p>Usage notes:
       <ul>
       <li>You need an internet connection to your PCH</li>
       <li>You should not have to change anything if indexing your internal HD - famous last words. Indexing other drives doesnt work at present. Probably will work with a single line edit.</li>
       <li>There will be some mis-identified files. Main culprits are
       <ul>
           <li>ISOs of TV box sets (I havent added any specific detection for that)</li>
           <li>Programs showning in multiple countries , The Office, Kath and Kim</li>
           <li>Any file with an odd naming convention</li>
       </ul>
       The best solution is to provide a manual fix up but low priority for now.
       <li>Colour buttons change sort order and TV/Film filtering</li>
       <li>[Blue] stuff is TV, [Green] is Film , [Red] is - not sure</li>
       <li>The [Remove] option just removes files from the index - they are not deleted</li>
       <li>The [Delete] option will delete files.</li>
       <li>There is a text message filter that works by selecting the number keys. When you see it it should make sense! There is room for improvement.</li>
   </ul>
   <hr>

     <a name="fixes"/>
    <p>The application has three parts:
        <ul>
            <li>unpak.sh - Only does &quot;intelligent&quot; unpacking.</li>
            <li>catalog.sh - Indexes video files and also has rename capability. Used by unpak.sh</li>
            <li>oversight 'WebService' - This is specific to the NMT platform and provides a web gui for the index built by catalog.sh</li>
        </ul>
         <p> You can get oversight in a number of ways:

            <td>
             <a name="unpak"/>
                 Alternatively select the following links to just download the unpak and catalog scripts (these can run on other platforms besides NMT):
                 <ol>
                 <li><a href="../unpak/unpak-BETA.zip">unpak-BETA.zip</a> Latest beta - recommended</li>
                 <li><a href="../unpak/unpak.zip">unpak.zip</a> Older unpak scripts</a> please try th beta before reporting any bugs </li>
             </ol>
             The unpak script is especially designed for platforms with low powered cpus. It will avoid par repairs if they will take too long, and it can react to unrar errors before the unrar command completes.
