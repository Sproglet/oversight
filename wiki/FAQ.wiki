Q How can I get oversight to rename and move Films that were already on the PCH *before* I installed oversight?

A ith telnet you can do

{{{/share/Apps/oversight/catalog.sh RENAME /share/Completed}}}

I would only do this if Oversight is getting all of the film names correct, otherwise they will end up in a wrongly named folder.
(This is one reason Oversight doesnt change the name of the actual avi file yet, I will only add that once Oversight becomes more accurate)
