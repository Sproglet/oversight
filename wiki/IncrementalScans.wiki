Oversight launches incremental scans in three instances:

  # On completion of a usenet download.
  # When new content is added to 'watch folder'
  # When a NMT Transmission Torrent is completed (this needs more testing)

I plan to have a rescan button against a particular item. 
First we need an edit option to change IMDB Id., fanart & poster links.
Then "save" or "save and rescan"

In the mean time you can manually rescan if you have telnet installed.

  # log in
  # type 'cd /share/Apps/oversight'
  # type './catalog.sh /path/to/new/media/folder'
  # Or to rescan AND get new posters type './catalog.sh UPDATE_POSTERS /path/to/new/media/folder'

----

Note in the next version of Oversight (est 21st November) incremental scans can be performed as follows:

  # In the Oversight GUI, _delist_ the item to be rescanned (dont _delete_ it!!)
  # Go to the Admin Screen, and select the Rescan Option
  # In the rescan screen select 'New Items Only', and Rescan.
